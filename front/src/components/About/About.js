      <p className='text'>I'm Usue Etxeberria Ramos, 24 year old freelance artist based in Madrid, Spain.
I studied design at Complutense University, but it wasn't until 2020 that I decided to start this project of line drawings based on 
people's pictures, friends and well knows used to send me their images, and I turned them into line designs. I open an account sharing
this art and some of my watercolor paintings which I love to create.</p>
